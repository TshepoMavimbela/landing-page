# landing-page
Here I created a single page responsive landing page. My thinking was that of a new chat app sign-up page.
I first codede the html using stock images for the pictures. Then used a CSS reset available online and created a separate CSS file. 
In that CSS I styled the pages from the mune bar first then the images, background colors and fonts.
From there I added some elements tomake it look more appealing by creating CSS shapes
